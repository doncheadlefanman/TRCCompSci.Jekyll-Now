buh

I am not frank, and you're watching disney channel. This is my blog post about my blog, very meta.  

### previous study

previously, on dragon ball z, i have made a hello world post i believe, and not much else. i dont think i made it, but because its there im taking 
credit because i am truly that cool. yesterday i bought 45 pence custard creams, because they are cheaper and have more biscuits per 45p spent compared to the slightly superior jeremy bourbons.
during computer we have done binary jazz, and thats pretty cool. floating point, negatives, fixed point, multiplication, and addition has been covered. 
programming has been started, and that has been previously studied previously. back in the day we didnt get graded on programming, and that was pretty sad considering we still had to it. 

#h my life story
back in my day, we didn't have to worry about using commie sharp, the commies are taking over, this is a bad thing, my account has been flagged and i am scared. 
when i was just a young boy, my father took me into the city, to see a marching band. when i was young, i cracked my head open on an exposed nail on the bottom of our wooden staircase, that i decided to do a sick trick roly poly down it. 
true story, i was bleeding, and i don't remember anything that's happened for the last 4 years or so. later on i cracked my head open again, after a sharp batman car with points on the side of it, was thrown at my head. after i mistook it for something that was usable for playing catch.
this really explains why i am such a melt. not a cheese melt, because that would be delicious, just a regular old melt.
